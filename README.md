### Hi there 👋

<!--
**SmisToken/SmisToken** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

SMIS TOKEN

THE FIRST SOLIDARITY TOKEN


SMIS promotes and rewards the solidarity movement. 
You will generate coins each time you carry out a solidarity act, each time you make a solidarity contribution, 
each time you recycle or participate as a volunteer in an initiative, or each time you donate blood. 
The SMIS project is ambitious and will continue to grow.

OUR APP

In the application that will be available on both android and ios and also within the website itself, you will have the option to manage your currencies.

You can connect it to your metamask wallet, you can choose to support certain projects that will appear using our main token, 
and with this you will get our secondary token, you can make staking of our main token and obtain as a reward a good percentage of interest in both our token primary as well as our secondary token. 
You can also manage your earnings from external donations to the APP, such as associating yourself with charities, 
specific donations to other entities and as a great objective of our initiative you can generate them with your mobile terminal if you use a function that we still keep secret and that you will meet at the launch of the app.



ABOUT
THE TOKEN/PROJECT


SUPPLY INFORMATION

50 million tokens are available for the entire projectare, 50 million tokens are the supply and no more coins will ever be generated, it will always be the maximum supply. 
The coins will be distributed among the different phases of the project.

TOKEN UTILITY

Tokens can be obtained in purchases but can also be obtained by participating in solidarity activities, solidarity projects, donating blood, recycling, helping the environment, etc. 
You can also obtain these tokens in the future options of the APP: staking, and with the new mobile option that we have not yet revealed. 
These tokens can be used in the application itself to make donations to entities and projects that will be presented periodically. 
In turn, any entity may request the presentation of a project, which will be valued and may appear in the application where users can make their donations.

SECONDARY TOKEN

With the launch of the app a new token will appear, it will be our secondary token and you can generate it in the APP with options such as staking or as the new mobile option, 
with which you can generate both the main token, SMIS and the secondary token. It’s your choice. This token can also be used in the app in different options.
